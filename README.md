# Experiment Overview and Business Decision-Making Goal

This experiment aimed to develop a machine learning classifier to predict whether clients would subscribe to a term deposit based on historical marketing and client data. Two models were tested—**KNN** and **XGBoost**—with XGBoost showing superior performance, particularly in recall (90%), making it highly effective for identifying potential subscribers.

## **Business Goal**  
The ultimate objective of this analysis is **to optimize marketing campaigns by accurately targeting clients most likely to subscribe**. By leveraging a high-recall model, the business can:

### 1. **Maximize Client Outreach**
Ensure that nearly all potential subscribers are identified and contacted, increasing the likelihood of campaign success.

### 2. **Resource Allocation**
Use insights from feature importance (e.g., call duration, account balance) to prioritize high-value clients, reducing wasted effort on unlikely subscribers.

### 3. **Enhance Campaign Effectiveness**
Adjust strategies to focus on impactful periods (e.g., campaigns in May) and improve engagement tactics during calls (e.g., extending call duration).

# Data Quality

## Data Preprocessing

### Goal
The preprocessing step focused on preparing the raw dataset for further analysis by:
- Removing irrelevant columns with high levels of "unknown" values.
- Filtering out rows with missing or invalid data.
- Ensuring appropriate data types for numerical and categorical variables.

### Steps
1. Imported the dataset using **pandas** and explored its structure (e.g., column names, data types, missing values).
2. Assessed categorical variables with "unknown" values and removed rows or columns as needed.
3. Generated descriptive statistics for numerical variables to identify potential outliers.

Example insights:
- **Average Age**: 41 years
- **Average Balance**: €1362, with significant variability.
- **Potential Outliers**: Extreme values in `balance`, `duration`, and `campaign`.


## Data Cleanup

### Goal
The cleanup process ensured the dataset was free from "unknown" or irrelevant values and ready for model training.

### Steps
1. Removed rows or columns based on thresholds for missing or "unknown" values.
2. Saved the cleaned dataset for further use.

### Outcome
 - Cleaned dataset with significant reductions in missing values.
 - Removed irrelevant columns, such as poutcome and contact.

## Outlier Detection

### Methodology
Used **Isolation Forest**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to detect and remove outliers. This approach was chosen for its robustness in handling multidimensional data and flexibility with non-normal distributions.

### Steps
1. Identified numerical columns for outlier detection.
2. Fitted the Isolation Forest model with a contamination rate of 5%.
3. Removed data points identified as outliers.

### Outcome
- Dataset reduced to 41,186 rows after removing outliers.
- Improved dataset reliability for subsequent analysis.


## Convert categorical variables to numerical

### Goal
Converting categorical variables to numerical values ensures compatibility with machine learning algorithms, improves model performance, enhances interpretability, and facilitates more efficient data storage and processing. 

### Methodology
**One-Hot Encoded**: This Encoding method fits becasue the data set showing small to medium cardinality and has nominal categorical variables where categories do not have a meaningful order.


## Scale the variables

### Goal
Scaling variables ensures that all features are on a comparable scale, improving model performance, reducing bias, enhancing interpretability, and maintaining numerical stability.

### Methodology
**StandardScaler**: Using StandardScaler ensures that the numerical features in the DataFrame are standardized to a common scale. This normalization can significantly enhance model performanceand and ensure that features with different units do not bias the model. It will also give better support for algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN), k-means clustering which rely on distance metrics, scaled features ensure that no single feature dominates the distance calculations.

## Univariate Analysis 

### Goal
To understand the distribution and characteristics of key features and their relationship to the target variable (term deposit subscription), providing insights for feature selection.

### Methodology
**Histograms**: Used histograms to examine the distribution of continuous variables (e.g., age, balance, call duration) to uncover patterns and skewness. This method is crucial in machine learning preprocessing, as understanding the distribution of data helps with feature engineering and selecting appropriate models, especially for algorithms sensitive to data distribution (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression).

**Boxplots**: Applied boxplots to detect outliers and visualize feature spread. Identifying outliers is essential for improving model performance, as extreme values can distort predictions, particularly in distance-based models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Key Observations
- **Call Duration**: Longer call durations are highly correlated with higher subscription rates, indicating deeper client engagement is key.
- **Balance**: Clients with higher balances show a significantly higher likelihood of subscribing, suggesting financial stability is a strong predictor.
- **Campaign Contacts**: Most successful subscriptions happen after the first contact, with diminishing returns for follow-up calls, highlighting the importance of effective initial outreach.


## Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

### Goal
Analyze the relationships between two or more variables to determinethe association and strength of association of variables through coorelation and visualizations, providing insights for feature selection. 

### Methodology
**Correlation Matrix**: Created a correlation matrix to determine which variables had a significant relationship with eachother. This method was important to identify variables with strong association for analysis. 

**Bar Charts**: Used bar charts for bivariate analysis to visualize the relationship between two variables. This method was important when analyzing variables for comparison over time or by volume to determine which combination of variables had the strongest association. 

**Scatter Plots**: Used scatter plots for multivariate analysis to visualize the relationship between two or more variables. This method was important for showcasing the relationship between two variables over time to identify patterns within the data. 

### Key Observations
- **Job Types**: Positive coorelation between certain job types and term deposit subscription. Through visualization, students, retirees and those who are unemployed were shown as most likely to subscribe to term deposits. 
- **Marital Status**: Positive coorelation between being single and term deposit subscription. Through visualization, single clients were shown as more likely to subscribe to term deposits than married or divorced clients.  
- **Balance, Age and Subscription Rate**: Clients between the ages of 20-70 with a balance of 0 to 10,000 were most likely to subscribe to term deposits. 
- **Summary**: From the insights, we can suggest that these categories of clients are more likely to take on the risk of term deposits and future marketing campaigns targeted towards these groups may be successful in increasing subscription rates.
